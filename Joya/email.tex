\subsection*{1. Email to the Mayor of Chittagong City Corporation}
\textbf{Subject:} Request to Establish a Children’s Park in Chittagong \\
Dear Honorable Mayor, \\
I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to kindly request your attention toward the need for a children’s park in our city. Chittagong, being a bustling urban area, lacks sufficient safe and engaging spaces where children can play, exercise, and spend quality time outdoors. A dedicated park would not only promote their physical and mental well-being but also enhance the beauty and livability of our city. \\
I urge the City Corporation to consider this proposal and take steps to identify a suitable location and allocate resources for this project. The children of Chittagong deserve a space of their own, and I am confident your leadership can make this a reality. \\
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you. \\
Sincerely, \\
Joya \\

\subsection*{2. Email to the Officer-in-Charge of Your Police Station}
\textbf{Subject:} Request for Action Against Antisocial Activities in Our Area \\
Dear Officer-in-Charge, \\
I hope you are doing well. I am reaching out to bring to your attention the growing issue of antisocial activities in our neighborhood. Residents have increasingly noticed incidents of vandalism, loitering, and disturbances, particularly during the evening hours. These activities are causing concern and disrupting the peace and safety of our community. \\
I kindly request that your team increase patrols in the area and take necessary measures to address these issues. Your prompt action would greatly reassure the residents and help restore a sense of security. \\
Thank you for your dedication to our safety. Please feel free to contact me if you need any specific details or assistance from the community. \\
Regards, \\

\subsection*{3. Email to Your Pen Friend}
\textbf{Subject:} A Glimpse of My Homeland \\
Dear [Pen Friend’s Name], \\
I hope you’re doing great! It’s been a while, and I thought I’d tell you a bit about my homeland since you’ve always been curious about it. I live in [Your Country/City], a place full of life and beauty. The landscapes here are stunning—think rolling green hills, rivers that shimmer under the sun, and bustling markets filled with colors and sounds. The people are warm and welcoming, and there’s always some festival or tradition to celebrate. \\
One of my favorite things is the food—spicy, flavorful dishes that you’d love if you ever visited! The weather can be unpredictable, but it adds to the charm. I’d love to hear about your homeland too—what makes it special to you? \\
Looking forward to your reply! \\
Take care, \\
Joya \\
\subsection*{4. Email to Your Younger Brother}
\textbf{Subject:} Why You Should Focus on Learning English \\
Hey [Brother’s Name], \\
How’s everything going? I wanted to drop you a quick note about something I think is really important—learning English. I know it might feel like just another subject, but trust me, it’s so much more than that. English opens doors to the world—whether it’s understanding movies, songs, or books, or even connecting with people from different countries. \\
It’s also a big deal for your studies and future job opportunities. Most of the cool stuff online—like games, tech, or science—is in English, and knowing it well gives you an edge. So, don’t slack off in class, okay? Practice a little every day, and you’ll see how fun it can be. Let me know if you need help—I’m here! \\
Take care, \\
Joya \\

I am writing to request your urgent assistance in providing relief materials to our area, which has recently been affected by [mention specific issue, e.g., floods, storms, etc.]. Many families here are struggling to access basic necessities like food, clean water, and shelter due to this crisis. \\
Your support in sending relief supplies at the earliest would be a lifeline for the affected residents. We trust in your leadership to help us through this difficult time, and I’d be happy to assist with any coordination needed on the ground. \\
Thank you for your attention to this matter. \\
Yours sincerely, \\
